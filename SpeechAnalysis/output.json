        "content": "Q: What is your name?|A: My name is Kevin Bacon, born July 8th, 1958.  \nQ: What brings you into the clinic today?|A: I have been having this horrible cough that just won't go away.  \nQ: When did this cough start?|A: About a week ago, it really started to get annoying.  \nQ: Were you doing anything when the cough first started?|A: No, not really. I was just at work and noticed a tickle in the back of my throat.  \nQ: Is your cough consistent throughout the day or does it seem to come and go?|A: No, I would say it's consistent throughout the day.  \nQ: Does anything seem to make your cough better or worse?|A: I did notice that when I was on my morning run the other day, I began coughing really badly and had to stop.  \nQ: So exercise makes it worse. Does anything make it better?|A: No, not really.  \nQ: Is this cough dry or are you coughing up mucus?|A: Yeah, every now and then I would cough up some mucus.  \nQ: Any pain or tightness in your chest?|A: Yeah, I guess I do feel some tightness in my chest before I cough, but no pain really.  \nQ: Have you been wheezing at all?|A: Yes, actually I have noticed that when I lay down to go to bed at night, I start wheezing.  \nQ: Have you felt short of breath recently?|A: No, I wouldn't say short of breath, just the occasional tightness in my chest.  \nQ: Any kind of fever, headache or chills?|A: No, that I've noticed.  \nQ: Any fatigue or unintentional weight loss?|A: Nope.  \nQ: Any swelling or lumps around your neck or throat?|A: Nope.  \nQ: Any recent infections or illnesses?|A: No, I would say being in good health lately.  \nQ: Have you ever had a cough like this in the past?|A: Um, yeah, I guess when I was a kid, I had asthma and I would get coughs like this once every nine days, but I haven't had it like this in years.  \nQ: Did you receive any kind of treatment?|A: Yes, I saw a pulmonologist who gave me some steroids, but I was told I could stop taking them so I did.  \nQ: Let me go ahead and perform a physical exam.|A: [No response to the request].",
