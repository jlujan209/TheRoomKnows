{"text": " Dr. Bavond, how are you feeling today? I'm feeling okay, but I've had this cough for a while and it's kind of really bugging me. It's really horrible. When did this cough start? The cough started about a week ago, I would say, and I think it's gotten worse. Has there been anything besides the cough you've been experiencing? No, not really anything I've noticed. Maybe a sore throat or something, but it's mostly the coughing.
