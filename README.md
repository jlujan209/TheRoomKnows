# The Room Knows

## Setup

You should probably make a virtual environment so your packages dont mess with eachother. In the future, we may need an environment for each subsystem, but for now, one environment is fine.

Here are the commands you need to run in order:

```shell
python -m venv env
```

```shell
env/Scripts/activate
```

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

First you create the environment, then you acivate it, and finally, install all the libraries we need. If you ever need to add a library, add it to the `requirements.txt` file. You should also make sure the environment is activated whenever you want to run the code. VScode usually does this for you, but sometimes it doesn't.
